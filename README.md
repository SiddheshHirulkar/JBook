# CodeBook
CodeBook is a note making app where one can create notes while learning any javascript project with Markdown syntex as well as writing the code snippet which will compiled in the real time environment and it will render the result immediately.

# CodeBook Teach Stack?
**Frontend** - Frontend is created using React Typescript.

**Backend** - Backend is designed using Firebase, although ***backend is not completely ready yet***, I work whenever I get free time but I hope I would be able to complete it within this year.

**Deployment** - The deployment is done through an automated script written on location `.github/workflows/workflow.yml`. Whenever a new pull request is merged in master branch, the script will run and deploy it to github pages.

**Hosting** - Right now CodeBook is hosted on GitHub Pages as it is an early stage (the backend work is pending), but once the app becomes ready I will host on recognised hosting platform with a good domain name.
